## Scope

I created mhu-lib as first of all projects. It contains utilities for different
problems. Some concepts going hand in hand but you can use the most of the
tools separately if you have no use for the other once.

Most of the utilities where created to be more effective then other
implementations like apache commons or google guave. In the meantime these
utilities are also very or more complete.
