## Scope

I created mhu-lib as first of all projects. It contains utilities for different
problems. Some concepts going hand in hand but you can use the most of the
tools separately if you have no use for the other once.

Most of the utilities where created to be more effective then other
implementations like apache commons or google guave. In the meantime these
utilities are also very or more complete.

## Annotations

This package contains all separate dependencies without deeper dependencies. Use it if don't want to include more dependencies and not need other tools the annotations and exceptions.

## Core

The core contains the general utilities. For casting of types, string utilities, and much more, [a not complete list](core.md).
